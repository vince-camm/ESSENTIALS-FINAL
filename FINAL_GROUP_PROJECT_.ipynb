It is not by all means useless, but we can easily fix the low r-squared. Variables like the club they play for and what league that club is in matters, and we clearly have highly statistically significant variables as it is so adding a couple more categorical would perfect the model."

Both of the Random Forrest claffication models that were performed (100 trees and 500 trees) had accuracy scores that were close to the KNN classifier with accuracy scores of 80.02% and 80.55%. The Decision Tree classification model performed the worst compared to the other models with an accuracy score of 76.32%. Overall, all the models had a fairly good accuray on the test set."
